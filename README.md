## Porfolio Overview

[Here](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)  is my NLP Overview

## Program #1 Text Processing
Here is the [code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework1/Homework1_jll180004.py) for assignment 1

 
 This assignment was an introduction to Python and use of other libraries like Pickle and regular expressions. In this assiignment, we were given the task to read in from a csv file, correctly format the data and display to the console. I found it fairly simple to process text using Python and learned how to utilize the dictionary data structure as well. 
 
## Program #2 Guessing Game
 
 Here is the [code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework2/HW2.py)

In this assignment we got an introduction to NLTK. We read from a text file that contained the first chapter of an anatomy textbook, preprocessed the text, and calculated the lexical diversity. Then we created a function that would run the guessing game using the top 50 common nouns from the text file. 
 

## Assignment #3 WordNet
 [Notebook](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework3/WordNet.ipynb) 
 
 In this assignment, we explored using the WordNet library to analyze synsets and used SentiWordNet to output scores in regard to the sentiment of each word. 

## Assignment #4 N-Gram Language Model

Built a language model from ngrams. Specificailly built a bigram and unigram dictionary for English, French, and Italian using provided training data. Here is the [code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/tree/main/ngrams)

## Assignment #5 	Sentence Parsing
For this assignment, we drew out how the parsing of a sentence would look like through PSG, dependency, and SRL parsing. 

## Assignment #6 Web Crawler
[Code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/WebCrawler/webcrawler.py)
Created a web crawler that is fed a link and it will search the web for related URLs based off of commonly seen words and was able to analyze most common words by using tf-idf. Then a knowledge base is sorted into a dicctionary and made into a pickle file.


## Assignment #7 Text Classification
Here is the [notebook](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/text-classification/TextClassification.ipynb%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf). We explored machine learning libraries related to NLP and trained a model to predict the sentiment of tweets during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I used a dataset from Kaggle for text classification that contained COVID-19 tweets and were classified as either negative, neutral or positive. We used Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks in this notebook. 
## Assignment #8 ACL Paper
I analyzed a paper from the ACL conference. Here is my [paper](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/NLP%20ACL%20Paper.pdf). I analyzed and summarized the paper titled, "Feeding What You Need By Understanding What You Learned". 

## Assignment #10 Text Classification 2 
A continuation of Text Classification but used Keras and deep learning model variation and embedding. This time I used a dataset regarding Fake News. Here is my [notebook](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/text_classification_2/Text%20Classification%202%20-%20Colaboratory.pdf) 

##Summary and Thoughts about Natural Language Processing

The field of NLP, AI, and Machine Learning is definitely one of my career interests in the future going forward. After taking this class, it exposed me to a lot of different concepts that I found very interesting and would love to work in a field related, especially with the field of AI finding more popularity.
