## Program #1 Text Processing
Here is the [code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework1/Homework1_jll180004.py) for assignment 1

 
 This assignment was an introduction to Python and use of other libraries like Pickle and regular expressions. In this assiignment, we were given the task to read in from a csv file, correctly format the data and display to the console. I found it fairly simple to process text using Python and learned how to utilize the dictionary data structure as well. 
 
## Program #2 Guessing Game
 
 Here is the [code](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework2/HW2.py)

In this assignment we got an introduction to NLTK. We read from a text file that contained the first chapter of an anatomy textbook, preprocessed the text, and calculated the lexical diversity. Then we created a function that would run the guessing game using the top 50 common nouns from the text file. 
 

## Assignment #3 WordNet
 [Notebook](https://github.com/tar0dev/HLTPortfolio/blob/main/homework3/WordNet.ipynb) 
 
 In this assignment, we explored using the WordNet library to analyze synsets and used SentiWordNet to output scores in regard to the sentiment of each word.
