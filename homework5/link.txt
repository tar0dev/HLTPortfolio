settled out of court with Bryant issuing a public apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual The accusation briefly tarnished Bryant s reputation resulting in the loss of

Catholic and he was brought up with this faith 19 20 21  Bryant started playing basketball when he was three 22 and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up 23 When Bryant was six his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball 24 25 After two years they moved first to Reggio Calabria then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian 26 He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made 27 28 Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia 29 30 Bryant s grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study 31 Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports from which he learned more about basketball 32 From 1987 to 1989 his father played for Olimpia Basket Pistoia where he paired with former Detroit Pistons Leon Douglas Kobe would work at the games as a ball and mop boy and would practice shooting at halftime with Douglas sharing At every one of our games at halftime it was the Kobe show He d get out there and get his shot up We d come out of the locker room at halftime and have to chase him off the court 33  Bryant also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was A C Milan 34 35 During summers Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league 36 When Bryant was 13 he and his family moved back to Philadelphia where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School 26 37  Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman 38 Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion s varsity team but the team finished with a 4 20 record 38 39 The following three years the Aces compiled a 77 13 record with Bryant playing all five positions 38 During his junior year he averaged 31 1 points 10 4 rebounds 5 2 assists 3 8 blocks and 2 3 steals 40 and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth team Parade All American nomination 41 42 attracting attention from college recruiters in the process 41 Duke Michigan North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list However after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros 41  At Adidas ABCD Camp Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award 43 while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom 44 While in high school then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team where he played one on one with Jerry Stackhouse 45 In his senior year of high school Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years During the run he averaged 30 8 points 12 rebounds 6 5 assists 4 steals and 3 8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31 3 record 46 Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania s all

First Team player 48 49 Bryant s varsity coach Greg Downer commented that he was a complete player who dominates and praised his work ethic even as the team s top player 46 50 In 1996 Bryant took R B singer Brandy to her Hollywood High senior prom 51 Ultimately the 17 year old Bryant made the decision to go directly into the NBA becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so 38 Bryant s news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when prep to pro NBA players were not very common Garnett being the only exception in 20 years 38 His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose 16 52 but he did not officially visit any campuses 50 In 2012 Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald s All Americans for his high school play as well as his later accomplishments 53   If you closed your eyes and thought a little bit you might have thought you were watching Michael Jordan He did everything well beyond well He was exceptional in everything that he did And then we commented as I recall on how reminiscent he was of Michael   Celtics general manager Jan Volk on Kobe Bryant during a pre draft workout in 1996 54  Before the 1996 NBA draft Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and according to then Laker general manager Jerry West marched over these people 55  The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player s draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free agent center Shaquille O Neal Bill Branch the Charlotte Hornets head scout at the time said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft Before the trade agreement the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant During the draft the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made 56 Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school After the draft the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles However on June 30 Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9 1996 when the league s off season moratorium ended 57 Since Bryant was still 17 at the time his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began 58 Bryant signed a three year rookie contract totaling 3 5 million 59  Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach California scoring 25 points in front of a standing room only crowd Defenders struggled to get in front of him and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris 60 He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24 5 points and 5 3 rebounds in four games 61 As a rookie in 1996 97 Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel 62 At the time he was the second youngest player ever to play in an NBA game 18 years 72 days and also became the youngest NBA starter 18 years 158 days 63 64 Initially Bryant played limited minutes but as the season continued he began to see some more playing time  By the end of the season he averaged 15 5 minutes a game During the All Star weekend Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest becoming the youngest dunk champion at the age of 18 65 Bryant s performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight 66  The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5 Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utah s Jeff Hornacek and Shaquille O Neal fouled out with 1 46 remaining in the fourth quarter Bryant shot four air balls at the end of the game the Jazz won 98 93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4 1 He first missed a game winning two point jump shot in the fourth quarter and then misfired 3 three point field goals in overtime including two tying shots in the final minute 67 O Neal commented that Bryant was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that 68  In Bryant s second season he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard As a result Bryant s point averages more than doubled from 7 6 to 15 4 points per game 69 Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers played small which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up 70 Bryant was the runner up for the NBA s Sixth Man of the Year Award 71 and through fan voting he also became the youngest NBA All Star starter in NBA history 72 He was joined by teammates O Neal Van Exel and Jones making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All Star Game Bryant s 15 4 points per game was the highest of any non starter in the season 73  The 1998 99 season marked Bryant s emergence as a premier guard in the league With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded Bryant started every game for the lockout shortened 50 game season During the season Bryant signed a six year contract extension worth 70 million 73 This kept him with the Lakers until the end of the 2003 04 season Even at an early stage of his career sportswriters were comparing his skills to those of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson 58 74 75 The playoff results however were no better as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals 76  Bryant s fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999 77 After years of steady improvement Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league earning appearances in the league s All NBA 78 All Star and All Defensive teams 79 The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center guard combination of Bryant and O Neal Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls this offense would help both Bryant and O Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA Three championships were won consecutively in 2000 2001 and 2002 further cementing this view 80  Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999 2000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards 81 When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999 2000 season This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game The duo of O Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games tied for fifth most in NBA history This followed with O Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All NBA Second Team and All NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career the youngest player to receive All Defensive honors 82 While playing second fiddle to O Neal in the playoffs Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25 point 11 rebound 7 assist 4 block game in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers 83 He also threw an alley oop pass to O Neal to clinch the game and the series In the 2000 Finals against the Indiana Pacers Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers Jalen Rose s foot Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally 84 85 Bryant did not return to the game and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury In Game 4 Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an OT victory as O Neal fouled out of the game Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120 118 86 With a 116 111 victory in Game 6 the Lakers won their first championship since 1988 87  Statistically the 2000 01 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year but he averaged six more points per game 28 5 It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O Neal began to surface 88 Once again Bryant led the team in assists with five per game The Lakers however only won 56 games an 11 game dropoff from the previous year The Lakers would respond by going 15 1 in the playoffs They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round In the semifinals round the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings In Game 4 against the Kings Bryant recorded 48 points 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119 113 series clinching win 89 They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Finals to advance to the Finals before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons During the playoffs Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29 4 points 7 3 rebounds and 6 1 assists per game In the playoffs teammate O Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league 46 Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second Team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row In addition he was also voted to start in the NBA All Star Game for the third year in a row no game in 1999  In the 2001 02 season Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career On January 14 2002 Bryant recorded a then career high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120 81 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 90 He continued his all round play by averaging 25 2 points 5 5 rebounds and 5 5 assists per game Bryant also had a career high 46 9 shooting and once again led his team in assists He claimed his first All Star MVP trophy after a 31 point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were going to cut your hearts out 91 92 While making the All NBA Defensive Team again Bryant was also named to the All NBA First Team for the first time in his career The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in state rival Sacramento Kings Bryant was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers March 1 2002 victory over the Pacers 93 94  The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4 1 in the first two rounds of the playoffs the Lakers did not have home court advantage against the Sacramento Kings The series would stretch to seven games the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals However the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance In the 2002 Finals against the New Jersey Nets Bryant averaged 26 8 points 51 4 shooting 5 8 rebounds 5 3 assists per game which included scoring a quarter of the team s points 95 At age 23 Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships 95 Bryant s play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs 95 96 This cemented Bryant s reputation as a clutch player  In the first game of the 2002 03 season Bryant recorded 27 points 10 rebounds 5 assists and 4 steals in an 87 82 loss to the visiting Spurs 97 On November 1 Bryant recorded a triple double of 33 points 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108 93 win over the LA Clippers 98 He also set an NBA record for three pointers in a game on January 7 2003 when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics 99 Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40 6 in the entire month of February In addition he averaged 6 9 rebounds 5 9 assists and 2 2 steals per game all career highs to that point 17 Bryant was once again voted to both the All NBA and All Defensive First Teams 17 and came in third place in voting for the MVP award After finishing 50 32 in the regular season the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs 100  In the following season the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship 101 Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began 102 This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later on the same day 103 In the final game of the regular season the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers Bryant made two buzzer beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title At the end of the fourth quarter Bryant made a three pointer with 1 1 seconds left to send it into overtime 104 The game eventually went to a second overtime in which Bryant made another three pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers 105 104 104  With a starting lineup of O Neal Malone Payton and Bryant the Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals 105 However they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons who won their first championship since 1990 106 In that series Bryant averaged 22 6 points per game and 4 4 assists while shooting 35 1 from the field 107 Jackson s contract as coach was not renewed and Rudy Tomjanovich took over 108 O Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom Caron Butler and Brian Grant 109 The following day Bryant declined a six year 100 million offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re signed with the Lakers on a seven year 136 4 million contract 110 111  Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004 05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season A Team in Search of Its Soul The book detailed the events of the Lakers tumultuous 2003 04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant In the book Jackson called Bryant un coachable 112 Midway through the season Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion 113 Without Tomjanovich stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen 114 Bryant was the league s second leading scorer at 27 6 points per game but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast and the Lakers went 34 48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade 115 The year signified a drop in Bryant s overall status in the NBA as he did not make the NBA All Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All NBA Third Team 116 During the season Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen 117 118  The 2005 06 season marked a crossroads in Bryant s basketball career Despite past differences with Bryant Jackson returned to coach the Lakers 119 Bryant endorsed the move and by all appearances the two men worked together well the second time around leading the Lakers back into the playoffs Bryant s individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career On December 20 2005 Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks Entering the fourth quarter Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62 61 the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the shot clock 120 When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16 2006 Bryant and Shaquille O Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them 121 122 A month later at the 2006 NBA All Star Game the two were seen laughing together 123  On January 22 2006 Bryant scored a career high 81 points in a 122 104 victory against the Toronto Raptors 124 In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor Bryant s 81 point game was the second highest point total in NBA history surpassed only by Chamberlain s 100 point game in 1962 125 Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win Bryant created his own shot mostly from the outside in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter 126 127 Chamberlain playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful 127 128 accounted for 59 percent of his team s points in Philadelphia s 169 147 win compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers 122 points 129 130 In that same month Bryant also became the first player since 1964 to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players to do so 131 For the month of January Bryant averaged 43 4 points per game 132 the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain 133 By the end of the 2005 06 season Bryant set Lakers single season franchise records for most 40 point games 27 and most points scored 2 832 134 He won the league s scoring title for the first time by averaging 35 4 points per game becoming just the fifth player in league history to average at least 35 in a season b Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award but received 22 first place votes second only to winner Steve Nash 137  Later in the season it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the 2006 07 season Bryant s first high school number was 24 before he switched to 33 138 139 After the Lakers season ended Bryant said on TNT that he wanted 24 as a rookie but it was unavailable as it was worn by George McCloud as was 33 retired with Kareem Abdul Jabbar Bryant wore 143 at the Adidas ABCD camp and chose 8 by adding those numbers 139 In the first round of the playoffs the Lakers played well enough to reach a 3 1 series lead over the Phoenix Suns culminating with Bryant s overtime forcing and game winning shots in Game 4 They came within six seconds of eliminating the second seeded Suns in Game 6 however they lost that game 126 118 in overtime 140 Despite Bryant s 27 9 points per game in the series the Lakers broke down and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games 140 After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 121 90 Game 7 loss to Phoenix 141 142  During the 2006 07 season Bryant was selected to his ninth All Star Game appearance and on February 18 he logged 31 points 6 assists and 6 steals earning his second career All Star Game MVP trophy 143 Over the course of the season Bryant became involved in a number of on court incidents On January 28 while attempting to draw contact on a potential game winning jump shot he flailed his arm striking San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili in the face with his elbow 144 Following a league review Bryant was suspended for the subsequent game at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks The basis given for the suspension was that Bryant had performed an unnatural motion in swinging his arm backward 145 Later on March 6 he seemed to repeat the motion this time striking Minnesota Timberwolves guard Marko Jarić 144 On March 7 the NBA handed Bryant his second one game suspension 146 In his first game back on March 9 he elbowed Kyle Korver in the face which was retroactively re classified as a Type 1 flagrant foul 144  On March 16 Bryant scored a season high 65 points in a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers which helped end the Lakers 7 game losing streak This was the second best scoring performance of his 11 year career 147 The following game Bryant recorded 50 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves 148 after which he scored 60 points in a road win against the Memphis Grizzlies becoming the second Laker to score three straight 50 plus point games a feat not seen since Jordan last did it in 1987 149 The only other Laker to do so was Baylor who also scored 50 in three consecutive contests in December 1962 149 In the following day in a game against the New Orleans Oklahoma City Hornets Bryant scored 50 points making him the second player in NBA history to have four straight 50 point games behind Chamberlain who achieved it twice with streaks of five and seven 150 Bryant finished the year with a total of ten 50 plus point games surpassed only by Chamberlain c Bryant also won his second straight scoring title that season 151 Throughout the 2006 07 season his jersey became the top selling NBA jersey in the United States and China 152 A number of journalists have attributed the improved sales to Bryant s new number as well as his continuing All Star performance on the court 153 154 In the 2007 NBA playoffs the Lakers were once again eliminated in the first round by the Phoenix Suns 4 1 155  On May 27 2007 ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority 156 Bryant later confirmed his desire for West s return to the franchise but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place 157 However three days later on Stephen A Smith s radio program Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers insider who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O Neal s departure from the team and publicly stated I want to be traded 158 Three hours after making that statement Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request 159 Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All Star Jason Kidd 160 161  On December 23 2007 Bryant became the youngest player 29 years 122 days to reach 20 000 points in a game against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden after scoring 39 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 8 assists 162 163 This record has since been broken by LeBron James On March 28 Bryant scored a season high 53 points to go with 10 rebounds in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies 164  Despite an injury to his shooting hand s small finger

the regular season instead of opting for surgery Regarding his injury he stated I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season and this summer s Olympic Games But this is an injury that myself sic and the Lakers medical staff will just have to continue to monitor on a day to day basis 165  Aided by the trade for All Star Pau Gasol Bryant led his team to a West leading
